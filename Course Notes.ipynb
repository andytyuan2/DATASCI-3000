    "    - Aiming to select variables and clean data (filter outliers, irrelevant variables, delete null values)\n",

    "- Dirty data that doesn't make sense in our context (Eg, age being negative, is 0 a true value or absence of something, incomplete data, duplicate)\n",
    "- Missing values **can be kept** since it may be valuable. It is good practice to create an additional category or indicator variable for them\n",
    "- Missing values **should be deleted** when there are too many missing values\n",
    "- Missing values **can be replaced** when you can estimate them using imputation procedures\n",
    "    - For *continuous variables*, replace with median or mean (median more robust to outliers)\n",
    "    - For *nominal variables*, replace with mode\n",
    "    - For *regression* or *tree-based imputation*, predict using other variables; cannot use target class as predictor if missing values can occur during model usage\n",
    "- Outliers **can be kept** as null values or **deleted** when they are invalid observations or out of distribution due to low sample value\n",
    "    - Some may be hidden in one-dimensional views of multidimensional data\n",
    "    - Invalid observations are typically treated as null values, while out of distribution are typically removed and a note is made in the policy\n",

    "\n",
    "A statistical model takes an input and gives an output. A model minimizes loss or error function by measuring the goodness of fit of the function. There are many examples of loss minimizing functions, such as *mean-square error* or *cross-entropy*(MLE)\n",

    "\n",
    "The \"best\" model is the one that minimizes the expected error over the full distribution of the set of input and output\n",
